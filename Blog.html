&nbsp; &nbsp; The main concern in today's world is saving lives from diseases like brain tumors. Modern technology has brought us a way to do this using artificial intelligence (AI) and special medical pictures called "MRIs". These pictures help doctors see inside our bodies, and AI helps them find problems.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Think of AI as a smart computer program that can look at these pictures and tell if something is wrong, like a brain tumor. This works because AI learns from a lot of examples and gets really good at spotting issues. One special type of AI is called a "convolutional neural network" or CNN. It's like a super-smart detective for pictures, especially in medicine.
<br>
									
&nbsp; &nbsp;The first step is to teach AI by showing it many pictures where doctors have marked the problem areas. This teaching takes a lot of time, and then the AI needs more time to practice on its own. This can be tricky because the AI has settings that need to be just right for it to work well.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;When the AI is ready, it can look at new MRI pictures and quickly say if there's a problem. This helps doctors make better decisions and catch issues early. But using AI in medicine has some challenges. Sometimes, AI makes mistakes, so it's important for a doctor to also check. This teamwork can improve accuracy.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Another challenge is that medical pictures are complex. Sometimes, different types of pictures are needed, and AI needs to handle all of them. Also, sharing these pictures while keeping people's privacy safe is important for research.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;For the future, we can make AI even better. We can teach it using examples from existing data, and this can save time. Also, using AI that has already learned from other problems can speed things up and make the results more accurate.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;In the end, this article shows that AI and special pictures (MRIs) are helping doctors find brain tumors and other issues. Even though there are challenges, like making sure AI is accurate and keeping information safe, we're moving towards a future where AI and doctors work together to keep us healthy.
